\begin{abstract}

We present long-term (months-years) X-ray spectral variability of the
Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365 as observed by {\it Swift}, which provides
well sampled observations over a much longer timescale (6 years) and a
much larger flux range than is afforded by other observatories. At
very low luminosities the spectrum is very soft, becoming rapidly
harder as the luminosity increases and then, above a particular
luminosity, softening again.  At a given flux level, the scatter
in hardness ratio is not very great, meaning that the spectral shape is
largely determined by the luminosity.  The spectra were summed in
luminosity bins and fitted with a variety of models. The best fitting model
consists of two power laws, one unabsorbed and another, more luminous,
which is absorbed. Interestingly, we find that the absorbing column
decreases with increasing luminosity, but that this result is not due
to changes in ionisation. We suggest that these observations might be
interpreted in terms of a wind model in which the launch radius is
fixed at a particular disc temperature and therefore moves outwards with
increasing accretion rate, i.e. X-ray increasing luminosity. Thus, depending
on the inclination angle of the disc relative to the observer, the absorbing column may decrease
as the accretion rate goes up. The weaker, unabsorbed, component may
be a scattered component from the wind.

\section{Introduction}
%====================================================================================================================================================================

X-ray spectral observations of Seyfert galaxies have shown that variability in the column of absorbing material between the X-ray source and the observer is very
common \citep{risaliti02}. The detection of variable absorption on a timescales of hours has indicated that the absorbing material must be close to the nucleus, at a
distance similar to that of the Broad Emission Line Region   \citep[e.g.][]{lamer,elvis04,puccetti}, with claims that complete occultations by Broad
Line
Region clouds have been observed on timescales of days \citep{risaliti07a}.


NGC 1365 is a nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy \citep{maiolino95} which displays a large amount of X-ray spectral variability \citep{risaliti09} on timescales of hours
to years \citep{brenneman}. These variations have been interpreted as the spectrum changing from being `transmission dominated' to `reflection
dominated'. When the spectrum is `transmission dominated' \citep[e.g.][]{risaliti00} the absorbing material is Compton thin and the transmitted component dominates
the
spectrum; when the spectrum is `reflection dominated'  \citep[e.g.][]{iyomoyo} the absorbing material is Compton thick, meaning the majority of direct emission is
absorbed
and reflected emission dominates the spectrum \citep{risaliti07b,matt}. 

The possibility that the spectral variations were entirely due to intrinsic changes in the source spectrum has been deemed unlikely because the amplitude of variation
seen on timescales of weeks cannot easily be explained with intrinsic variation alone - the intrinsic flux would be required to change by almost two orders of magnitude
in this time, necessitating a the X-ray source to switch off completely and on again during this period \citep{risaliti07b,risaliti05b}. 

A large number of absorption and emission lines have been seen in the spectrum, attributed to FeXXV and FeXXVI K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ transitions, which are generally
found not to vary significantly \citep{risaliti05b}.

Although there have been many previous X-ray spectral studies of NGC 1365, these studies have all concentrated either on detailed analysis of a single epoch spectrum or
on analysis of a small number of spectra taken over a relatively short timescale (hours or days). By contrast, here we study 190 {\it Swift} spectra taken over a period
of six
years. Whilst {\it Swift} does not provide spectral resolution as high as that used in most previous short-time X-ray spectral studies, e.g. with {\it XMM-Newton} or {\it
Suzaku}, the {\it Swift} data cover a much longer time period and a far greater flux range. The {\it Swift} data therefore allow a proper investigation of flux-related
spectral variability and of long term spectral variations, over a much larger dynamic range than in previous studies.

\section{Observations \& Data Reduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Observations of NGC1365 using the {\it Swift} satellite have been carried out as part of a number of different programmes, the combined data from which has been used in
this
study. The observations were performed using the {\it Swift} XRT in `photon counting mode', between 21 July 2006 and 17 March 2013. A total of 293 spectra from individual
{\it Swift} `visits', or exposures, with a total of more than $220$ kiloseconds of exposure time. Individual exposure times ranged from $<10$ seconds to $>1900$ seconds.
Data were mostly confined to three main time periods, shown in Table \ref{obstable}. More intensive monitoring took place between MJD 56220 - 56330, due to Supernova
2012fr, which went off in NGC 1365 during this period (but which was neither bright enough nor close enough to the nucleus to affect the data used in this study 
\citep[e.g.][]{klotz,childress}. Of the 293 spectra, 103 were rejected due either to very low total counts in the exposure or artifacts near the source,
leaving 190 usable spectra, consisting of $\sim165$ kiloseconds of exposure time and over 25000 photon counts. The raw data for all {\it Swift XRT} observations of NGC
1365 were downloaded from the HEASARC archive\footnotetext[1]{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/W3Browse/swift.pl}.

The XRT data were reduced using an automatic pipeline, fully described in \citet{fabian12} and previously used in e.g. \citet{cameron}. In each case, the reduction used
the most recent version of the standard {\it Swift} XRTPIPELINE software (versions 0.12.4 - 0.12.6). The XSELECT tool was used to extract spectra and lightcurves using
the flux-dependent source and background extractions regions which are chosen such as to reduce the background contamination at faint fluxes, and to mitigate the effects
of pile-up at high fluxes. The sensitivity of the XRT is not uniform over the field of view, due to vignetting and the presence of bad pixels and columns on the CCD; the
{\it Swift} XRTEXPOMAP and XRTMKARF tools were therefore used to generate an exposure map (including vignetting and bad pixels) and an ancillary response file (ARF) for
each visit, in order to correct for these effects. The relevant redistribution matrix file (RMF) from the {\it Swift} calibration database was also spplied in each case.
The X-ray background was estimated and subtracted from the instrumental count rates, using the area-scaled count rate measured in a background annulus region. The
observed XRT count rates were carefully corrected for the fraction of counts lost due to bad pixels and columns, vignetting effects, and
the finite extraction aperture (including regions excised in order to mitigate pileup effects).

\subsection{Spectral Hardness}
%====================================================================================================================================================================

Plots of the hardness ratio against the hard count rate, and the hard count rate against the soft count rate are shown in Figs. \ref{hardness} and \ref{counts}
respectively. Whereas most previous measurements of the photon index, $\Gamma$, concentrate on the $2.0-10.0$ keV energy band, here we look at spectral shape across a
broader range of $0.5-10.0$ keV; as lower energies are more sensitive to absorption, this allows a more complete look at spectral changes due to absorbing material. In
each case, hard emission is defined as $2.0 - 10.0$ keV and soft emission as $0.5-2.0$ keV. The hardness ratio is defined as: 

\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hardness\ Ratio} = \frac{\mathrm{Hard\ Count\ Rate} - \mathrm{Soft\ Count\ Rate}}{\mathrm{Hard\ Count\ Rate} + \mathrm{Soft\ Count\ Rate}}
\end{equation*}
\hspace{0.5cm}
 
 Figs. \ref{hardness} and \ref{counts} show the spectrum to be extremely soft at very low fluxes, but to become hard very rapidly with with increasing flux. Beyond
this sharp rise, still at a
relatively low flux, the hardness decreases again more gradually with increasing flux, as often seen in Seyfert galaxies within the $2.0-10.0$ keV band 
\citep[e.g.][]{sobolewska,lamer}. The data display a relatively small amount of scatter about this general trend; for this reason, the shape of the spectrum can
be assumed to be approximately similar at a given flux level, independent of time. This implies that the system is behaving in approximately the same manner at each flux
level, irrespective of what state the system was in at an earlier time, allowing flux-binning of spectra to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 190 separate time-resolved XRT spectra of NGC1365 were divided into 11 flux bins and combined using the {\it HEADAS} tool `addspec' (see Fig. \ref{spectra} for a
sample of these summed spectra). The bins were chosen such that each bin had both a minimum of 1500 total counts and a minimum width of 0.025 counts s$^{-1}$; this
ensured that each summed spectrum would possess a sufficient signal to noise ratio for accurate spectral fitting, and that the flux bins were roughly evenly spaced across
the flux range covered by the spectra. Each of these summed spectra were then grouped in energy, using the {\it HEADAS} tool `grppha', such that each group contained a
minimum of 15 counts.

A variety of models were fitted to the spectra, using the {\it XSPEC} 12.7 analysis package \citep{arnaud}. The models were simultaneously fitted to all 11 summed
spectra, in order to discover the cause of variations in the shape of the spectrum with changing flux.  

It was discovered that a single, unabsorbed power law of photon index $\sim 1.92$ (as found by \citealt{risaliti13}), fitted the lowest flux observations very well if
combined with a Gaussian at $\sim 0.8$ keV, except for a small excess at higher energies ($> \sim 4.0$ keV). With increasing total flux, this excess was seen both to
increase in flux relative to the lower energy component and to expand to lower energies, such that the single power law model become increasingly inadequate. 

At the highest fluxes, it was found that a single power would fit the data very well if absorbed by a partially ionised absorbing column. This model was, however, still
insufficient to give a good fit at intermediate fluxes, as these spectra had a comparable flux at both the low- and high-energy ends of the spectra.

Motivated by the steep unabsorbed spectrum, with its high energy excess, found at low fluxes, and the absorbed component found at the higher fluxes, a set of
two-component models were fitted to the data; these models consisted of two power laws, one of which was unabsorbed and the other absorbed, with the absorbing column and
ionisation parameter left as either free or tied parameters. These models were found to fit the data well in simultaneous fits of the spectra from all flux ranges.

In these two-component models, the two power laws had the same spectral index, $\Gamma$, fixed at the value found by \citet{risaliti13} using the very wide spectral
range allowed by {\it NuStar}. It was also possible to obtain good fits at all fluxes using an absorbed, pivoting power law. However, the best fits required a very large
range of $\Gamma$ (from $\sim 0.55$ to $\sim 1.85$), and a very low value of $\Gamma$ at high fluxes (see Table \ref{table}.

It is not known for certain whether the intrinsic spectral index, $\Gamma$, varies or not during changes in X-ray luminosity. Many groups 
\citep[e.g.][]{miller08,turner07,fabian05,pounds04} assume that there is no change. Observations in the $2-10 keV$ band generally do show some
variation, although the changes with luminosity are not large  \citep[e.g.][]{sobolewska,zdziarski99}. \citet{sobolewska}, for example, who simply fit a power
law to the 2-10 keV spectra, find that the observed $\Gamma$ varies as 2.7$\dot m ^{0.08}$ over similar time scales to that of our data; in reality these measurements
are, of course, depend on other parameters which were not included, such as the reflection component and any absorption. If the variation in the observed spectral index
is interpreted in terms of the sum of a variable, steep spectrum component and a relatively constant reflection component with a hard spectrum, the intrinsic spectral
index can remain constant; in this case, when the flux of the variable steep spectrum component is low, the hard spectrum component dominates, causing the observed
spectral index to change  \citep[e.g.][]{guainazzi99,uttley99,ponti,fabian03}. Furthermore, where observations with a large spectral range have been
made, allowing good definition of the primary continuum slope, the observed variation of $\Gamma$ with luminosity has not been large (e.g. 0.1 in NGC4151,
\citealt{lubinski10}), 0.2 in NGC4507, \citealt{braito}).

Theoretical Comptonisation modelling  \citep[e.g.][]{beloborodov99,coppi92} shows that the photon index can depend on the ratio of $L_{diss}$ to $L_s$ (where
$L_{diss}$ is the power dissipated in the corona during variations and $L_s$ is the input soft photon luminosity) to a low power (-0.1 for AGN). Unless there are very
large variations in these parameters the intrinsic spectral index should therefore not change by more than a few tenths. Thus, although it is possible that a small change
in spectral index may occur during the flux range sampled by our observations, the large changes in $\Gamma$ required by the pivoting power law models are assumed to
be unlikely. Our first order approximation of no change in spectral index is likely to be a reasonable approximation. 


In each model, the absorbed power law was modelled using the `Absori' model for an ionised photoelectric absorber. The absorber temperature was tied for each fit. A
redshift of $5.569 \times 10^{−3}$ \citep{lavaux} and an iron abundance of 2.8 times solar abundance, as found by \citet{risaliti09}, were used in all fits. An emission
line was added to all of the models, due to an excess in the residuals of the models before its inclusion, particularly at lower fluxes as the line flux appears to be
constant; its addition lowered the reduced $\chi^2$ by approximately $0.10$ in the two-component model with a tied ionisation state. The line was fitted with a Gaussian
initially fixed at $0.8$ keV, with width $0.1$ keV , and whose normalisation was tied; the width and position were then tied but allowed to vary in each model. In the
two-component model with a tied ionisation state, this gave final values of $E = 0.834$ keV and $\Sigma = 0.100$ keV. The emission line is most likely to be due to an
iron L-shell transition, whose detection is particularly expected in Seyfert galaxies with a high iron abundance  \citep[e.g.][]{markowitz, fabian09}, as appears
to
be the case for NGC 1365 \citep{risaliti09}; its presence is made still more likely by the previous detection of K-shell transition lines \citep{risaliti05a}. Galactic
absorption of $1.39 \times 10^{−20}$ $cm^{-2}$ was also included \citep{dickey90}. The effects of Compton Scattering on the fits were tested by adding the `Cabs' model in
{\it XSPEC}, but were found to be negligible.

The column of the absorbing material, and its ionisation parameter, were also allowed to vary in different ways in different fits. The matrix of the variations
of the two-component model, together with each goodness of fit, is given in Table \ref{table}.

In all of the two-component fits in which the absorbing column was allowed to vary, the normalisation of the absorbed power law increases, and the absorbing column
decreases, with increasing total flux. The normalisation of the unabsorbed power law also increases. A representative sub-set of the 11 spectra are shown in Fig.
\ref{spectra}.

As can be seen from the $\chi^2$ values of each model, leaving the ionisation state to vary, but tying the absorbing column, was found to be insufficient to account for
the degree of variation observed in the spectra, at any fixed absorbing column, for both a pivoting power law and the two-component model. 

Tying the ionisation state, however, so that it stays constant at all flux levels, whilst leaving the absorbing column free to vary, gives good fits to the data with the
two-component model. Significantly, the $\chi^2$ value remains the same as the model in which both the ionisation state and absorbing column are left free to vary; this
is because the ionisation varies very little in the best fit model, meaning the fits are very similar. 

Tying the ionisation state in the pivoting single power law model gives a significantly worse fit compared to when both ionisation state and absorbing column are left
free. This implies that the goodness of the fit in the case where these parameters are free is due mainly to the large number of free parameters, as opposed to the
accuracy of the model. We therefore believe that the model which most accurately describes the data consists of two power laws, one of which is absorbed by material with
an approximately constant ionisation state, but with a varying absorbing column. Whilst the ionisation state of the absorbing material undoubtedly changes, the data show
both that large changes are not required to change to give a good fit, and that large changes in the absorbing column are essential to account for the spectral variation
observed regardless. Changes in ionisation alone cannot account for these spectral changes observed.

spectral index of 1.95, as found by \citet{risaliti13}. The ionisation state of the absorbing material is tied, but the absorbing column is allowed to vary between

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fig. \ref{spectra} shows a sample of the flux-binned spectra fitted with the two-component model described above, which we believe best describes the variability.  Here
the spectrum is composed of an unabsorbed power law and an absorbed power law. Fig. \ref{modelSpectra} shows how the two power law components vary as the flux changes.
The plot shows that absorbing column of the absorbed power law decreases as the normalisation of this power law increases, equivalent to the flux before absorption. These
two parameters are plotted in Fig. \ref{nhplots} and the strong anticorrelation is confirmed. 

In Fig. \ref{normplots} the normalisation of the unabsorbed power law is plotted against that of the absorbed power law. As is apparent by eye, the normalisations can be
fitted well with a linear model, showing them to be correlated. This implies a causal link between the components, and shows that the flux variations
are partly due to intrinsic variations of the nuclear source, and not only due to variations in absorption. An F-test shows that a model in which the two
normalisations pass through the origin is more likely than a model with an offset (F-statistic = 0.00756, 93.26\% confidence), but that an offset cannot be entirely ruled
out; a residual unabsorbed component when the absorbed flux is zero would indicate a constant, low luminosity, unabsorbed component, perhaps from large scale starburst
emission, which would not be resolved in the {\it Swift} images.

As a consistency check, the hard and soft count rates from each model fitted to the summed data were plotted over the original data as in Figs. \ref{hardness} and

reinforcing the assumption that the spectrum is similar at a given flux level, independent of time.

A two component spectral model consisting of an unabsorbed scattered component and a more luminous absorbed component has previously been used to describe the single
epoch spectrum of NGC4945 (Done et al, 1996). Broadly similar two-component spectra are also reported elsewhere  \citep[e.g. NGC4507,][]{braito}. Variations of
hardness
ratio versus count rate similar to those shown here, in Fig. \ref{hardness}, have also been seen in the spectra of X-ray binary systems (Fig.1 in \citealt{kuulkers})
from RXTE data (2-13 keV). Although	\citet{kuulkers} do not discuss flux-binned spectra as seen in our Fig. \ref{spectra}, they also favour a similar two component
model. These studies show that a two component model broadly similar to that which we describe here can, not infrequently, be used to parameterise the X-ray spectra of
both AGN and X-ray binary sources. However, the main contribution of this paper is to show, for the first time, that the complete, and very large, range of spectral
variability displayed by at least one AGN can be explained by systematic variation of the absorber, with the absorption varying inversely with luminosity. Below we
discuss a possible model to explain this behaviour.

\subsection{A Possible Relationship Between Source Flux and Column Density}
%====================================================================================================================================================================
	

For the best-fitting two-component model described above, in which the absorbing column is free to vary, but the ionisation state is tied, Fig. \ref{nhplots} shows the
column of absorbing material to be inversely related to the normalisation parameter of the absorbed power law, i.e. to the flux prior to absorption. As this component
dominates the unabsorbed luminosity of the source, the absorbing column is inversely proportional to the source luminosity. Whilst one might initially assume any
reduction in absorption with increasing flux to be due to increased ionisation, we have shown that models involving varying ionisation alone do not fit the data; models
allowing variation of ionisation and absorbing column simultaneously also require an inverse relationship between the absorbing column and the unabsorbed luminosity and
do not require the ionisation to vary significantly. Fits to spectra of NGC 4151 by \citet{lubinski10} at different flux levels show a similar reduction in nH with
increasing flux, implying this relationship is not unique to NGC 1365. A physical mechanism is required to explain this relationship and a possible solution lies in an
`X-ray wind’ of absorbing material rising from the accretion disc.

%====================================================================================================================================================================
\subsection{AGN Wind Model}
%====================================================================================================================================================================

%===========================

X-ray absorbing outflows are often attributed to a disc wind \citep{tombesi}. In the AGN model proposed by \citet{elvis}, absorbing material arises from a narrow range of
accretion disc radii in a biconical `wind'. \citet{nicastro} shows that an X-ray absorbing wind could originate from a narrow boundary region between the radiation
pressure-dominated and gas pressure-dominated regions of the accretion disc. In these models, a rise in accretion rate, which will give rise to an increase in X-ray
luminosity, naturally leads to an increase in the radii from which the wind arises through at least two mechanisms.  Firstly, a higher accretion rate leads to an
increase in disc temperature and hence an increase in the radii from which the wind arises.  Secondly, a higher accretion rate leads to increased ionising uv flux from
the inner disc. When potential wind material at the disc surface is fully ionised, it is only subject to Compton scattering and the much more powerful line-driving effect
\citep{proga99} is no longer be applicable, hence this material would never be driven off as a wind. Thus, if the inclination is such that the observer views the
X-ray source through the inner part of the wind, an increase in accretion rate would move the wind outwards such that the observer would now be viewing the source through
a lower absorbing column.  An additional geometric factor which would reduce absorbing column is that, in the \citet{elvis} model, an increase in X-ray luminosity causes
the opening angle of the wind to increase due to the increased radiation pressure. The above affects will thus naturally lead to the inverse relationship between
absorbing column and luminosity which we see. Moving the absorbing wind to larger radii also means that the line of sight would go through the less dense, more highly
ionised front part of the wind, as we see in our fits. % !!! Needs to be checked !!!

Depending on which mechanism dominates in pushing the wind to larger radii with increasing accretion rate, we expect different lags between the change in absorbing column
and the change in luminosity which could lead to hysteresis and scatter in the X-ray luminosity / hardness relationships.

If the outward movement of the wind launch radii is caused by a change in disc temperature due to inwardly propagating accretion rate fluctuations, then the
X-ray luminosity will lag by the viscous travel time of those fluctuations to either the inner edge of the disc where the seed photons are mainly produced and/or to the
X-ray emitting corona itself. For typical wind launch radii of a few hundred $R_g$ \citep{higginbottom}, this timescale would be of order weeks to months. 

%% [[ ELSEWHERE YOU HAD ``AROUND A DAY'' - WAS THAT OLD?? WHICH IS CORRECT?]] Weeks to months in correct
% whilst the wind is expected to
% respond to variations immediately (\citet{treves},\citet{shakura},
% \citet{tombesi}).The sampling of the present Swift data therefore is
% not sufficient to investigate any possible hysteresis effect further.

%=============

If the outward movement of the wind is dominated by an increase in ionising UV photons from the inner edge of the disc, which also dominate the X-ray seed photon flux,
then variations in the X-ray luminosity will lead changes in the absorbing column slightly, by the difference between the light travel time from the UV region to the wind
and to the corona respectively. This difference is likely to be small (hours). Alternatively, if the wind moves outwards in response to increased UV flux, but the X-ray
luminosity rises in response to increased accretion rate rather than increased seed photon flux, then the X-ray luminosity will lag by the difference between the viscous
propagations time from the UV to X-ray emitting regions and the light travel time from the UV emitting to wind launch radii. This difference is also likely to be small
(1-2 days).

Our observations do not show a great deal of scatter in the hardness-count rate diagram, indicating that any lags are short. We therefore favour a mechanism where the
wind launch radii are pushed outwards mainly by a rise in ionising UV flux, rather than by a rise in local disc temperature. 

Finally, we note that, in all models, the wind is expected to be clumpy, meaning short timescale variations of the absorbing column, independent of unabsorbed luminosity,
should also occur, which would also add scatter to the relationship between X-ray luminosity and absorbing column.

\section{Conclusions}
%====================================================================================================================================================================

{\it Swift} X-ray observations of NGC 1365 over a period of 6 years show a large amount of spectral variability. These variations are best explained by a two-component
model
consisting of an unabsorbed power law and a more luminous absorbed power law; for both components, the spectral index was fixed. The normalisations of the two power laws
vary together. The absorbing column of the absorbed power law varies inversely with its luminosity, an effect which is not simply due to increased ionisation. This effect
can be simply explained by viewing through the edge of a wind whose launch radius varies inversely with increasing accretion rate. The unabsorbed power law can be
explained, as in the standard Elvis wind model, as the scattered component from the far side of the wind.
